      <h2>About Myself</h2>
      <p>I am a 17-year-old student and developer. Previously, I was deeply involved in the Android platform, passionately compiling kernels and ROMs for my phone and my friends' phones. Furthermore, my fascination with jailbreaking began with iOS 7, leading me to create a variety of Cydia tweaks and themes.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am on a personal journey of self-improvement, striving to better myself with each passing day. While some may still recognize me as the Harry they have known for a long time, the truth is that I have evolved significantly from the person I was years ago.
        
        This is a result of my past experiences and the traumas I have faced. Without those challenging moments, I would not have achieved what I have today, despite appearing worn out in real life.
        
        There is also a side of me—the part of Harry—that I find most displeasing. This version lacks genuine human emotions and merely attempts to imitate them. Unfortunately for him, mimicking emotions will not bring him any fulfillment or satisfaction.</p>
      <h2>My current goal is self-improvement and personal growth.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I prioritize getting sufficient sleep either from 7:45 p.m. or 8:00 p.m.</li>
        <li>It is advisable for me to incorporate a healthy amount of fish and rice into my diet.</li>
        <li>I will dedicate my free time to studying.</li>
        <li>I aim to engage in physical exercise at least four or five times a week.</li>
        <li>No games. I have abstained from playing games since 2020, as I am not particularly addicted to gaming. Instead, I have developed a strong interest in reading manga, manhwas, webtoons, light novels, and manhuas.</li>
